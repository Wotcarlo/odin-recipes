    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Poor man's pasta is an easy-to-assemble baked ground beef and noodle dish. Layers of simmered tomato beef sauce and creamy egg noodles, along with plenty of cheese, make this pasta taste rich with only simple ingredients.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>

                <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.  Add ground beef, garlic, and jalapeno and cook, crumbling with a wooden spoon until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce. Add water to the can to release any residual sauce; pour into the pan along with salt and pepper. Bring mixture to a simmer. Cook 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. </p>
